# Shiny Matlab
Code for a Matlab-HTML app that resembles those created by R Shiny. 

The App allows to intuitively input values to a simple discrete SIR model and generates a plot that is read by Matlab.

To use the App download all files and open `Modelo_SIR.html` with Matlab's browser (**it only works with Matlab browser**).
